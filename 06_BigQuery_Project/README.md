BigQuery Data Analysis - Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis using Google BigQuery. I created a dataset by uploading various files and executed multiple SQL queries to extract valuable insights.

Project Overview
The analysis involves working with a dataset that includes various business metrics. The following queries were executed to analyze key aspects of the business:

Order Overview

Revenue by Payment Type

Seller Standouts

Delivery Insights

Yearly Growth

Product Popularity

City Spotlight

Category Kings

Bestsellers

Payment Panorama

Each query aims to provide a deeper understanding of different areas of the business, such as order trends, revenue breakdown, and product performance.

Video Demonstration
A 35-second video showcasing the SQL queries and their outputs is provided for a quick overview of how the analysis was performed in BigQuery.
