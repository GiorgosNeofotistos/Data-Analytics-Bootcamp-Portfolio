# Liquor Sales Analysis - Python Project

This project analyzes liquor sales data for the years 2016-2019 using Python. The analysis focuses on determining the most popular item in each zipcode and calculating the sales percentage per store.

## Project Overview

We are provided with a dataset detailing Liquor Sales in Iowa, USA, spanning the years 2012-2020. The goal of this project is to:

1. **Identify the most popular item** in each zipcode for the years 2016-2019.
2. **Calculate the sales percentage** for each store based on their total sales in dollars.

The dataset can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/courses_data/Assignment%20CSV/finance_liquor_sales.csv).

## How to Run the Code

To run the Python script, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. The script is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly` (optional, if you want to experiment with interactive visuals)

To install the libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Tasks
1. Most Popular Item in Each Zipcode
A bar chart is used to show the most popular liquor item in each zip code based on the total number of bottles sold during the period 2016-2019. The x-axis represents the zip code, and the y-axis represents the number of bottles sold. The chart helps to visualize the most popular items per geographic region.

2. Top 10 Stores by Sales Percentage
A pie chart displays the top 10 stores based on the percentage of total sales from 2016 to 2019. The chart represents the proportion of total sales each store contributes during this period.

Disclaimer
This project is based on exercises provided by Workearly's Data Analytics Bootcamp. The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills using Python.

Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into which items are most popular in each zipcode and the sales performance of each store. The visualizations allow for easy understanding of the trends and insights derived from the data.
